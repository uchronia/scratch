Created a plain text file (via the file extension .txt) at the root level of the uchronia/scratch repo.

Edit #3: Just adding some additional text following the initial commit above, but preceding the second commit below.

This is the first new file checked into the uchronia/scratch repo while learning GitHub from Episode 1:1 of https://tinyurl.com/GitHubForPoets
